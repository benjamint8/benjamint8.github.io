Hello! I'm Benjamin, an incoming doctoral candidate in mechanical engineering with an urban science concentration at New York University. I have research experience covering a number of topics, including walkability, renewable energy integration, and fluid dynamics. My career objective is to integrate these experiences with local efforts to advance climate resilience and emissions reduction through equitable, accessibility-focused urban form adaptations.

Relationally speaking, I'm the son of [Dr. James Tarver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-t-9b441b5/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Dr. Laurie Issel-Tarver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurie-issel-tarver-166a019/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, brother of [Kathryn Tarver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathryn-tarver/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, number one fan of [Julia Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julialee123/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and occasional treat provider to [Toby](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQNY1zPjn_T){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

If you would like to get in touch, please feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:benjamin.tarver@nyu.edu).
