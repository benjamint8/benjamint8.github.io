I'm Benjamin, an incoming doctoral candidate in mechanical engineering with an urban science concentration at New York University. Broadly speaking, I will be researching scalable computational methods for augmenting climate resilience planning efforts (e.g., using deep learning to optimize risk management strategies for wildfires or coastal flooding). I have research experience covering a number of topics, including walkability, renewable energy integration, and fluid dynamics. My career objective is to apply my quantitative analysis skillset to local efforts advancing climate resilience and emissions reduction through equitable, accessibility-focused urban form adaptations.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking vegetarian meals, playing puzzle games and narrative-centric RPGs, walking long distances through interesting (land/city)scapes, and reading anything with a compelling premise.
